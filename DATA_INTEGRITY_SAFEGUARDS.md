# Data Integrity Safeguards

This document outlines the comprehensive safeguards implemented to prevent data integrity issues in the esports statistics system.

## Issues Prevented

1. **Cross-team contamination**: Players from one team getting records in another team's matches
2. **Duplicate records**: Multiple records for the same player/hero/match combination
3. **Invalid matches**: Matches with no teams data or incomplete information
4. **Data inconsistency**: Mismatch between database counts and UI displays

## Safeguards Implemented

### 1. StatisticsSyncService Enhancements

#### Team Validation
- **Location**: `app/Services/StatisticsSyncService.php` lines 177-187
- **Function**: Validates that players belong to the correct team before creating records
- **Action**: Skips record creation if player doesn't belong to the match's team
- **Logging**: Logs security violations for monitoring

#### Duplicate Prevention
- **Location**: `app/Services/StatisticsSyncService.php` lines 192-216
- **Function**: Checks for existing records before creating new ones
- **Action**: Skips creation if record already exists
- **Logging**: Logs duplicate attempts for monitoring

#### H2H Duplicate Prevention
- **Location**: `app/Services/StatisticsSyncService.php` lines 208-227
- **Function**: Prevents duplicate H2H statistics records
- **Action**: Checks for existing H2H records before creation

### 2. Data Integrity Validation Methods

#### validateTeamDataIntegrity()
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive validation of team data
- **Checks**:
  - Records in wrong matches
  - Duplicate hero success rate records
  - Duplicate H2H records
- **Returns**: Status and detailed issue list

#### cleanupTeamDataIntegrity()
- **Purpose**: Automatic cleanup of data integrity issues
- **Actions**:
  - Removes records from wrong matches
  - Removes duplicate records (keeps first, deletes rest)
  - Logs all cleanup actions

### 3. Match Creation Validation

#### Player Team Assignment Validation
- **Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/GameMatchController.php` lines 721-761
- **Function**: Validates all players belong to the correct team before match creation
- **Action**: Throws exception if player doesn't belong to team
- **Security**: Prevents cross-team contamination at source

### 4. Console Commands

#### Data Integrity Check Command
```bash
# Check specific team
php artisan data:integrity-check --team=CG

# Check all teams
php artisan data:integrity-check

# Check and fix issues
php artisan data:integrity-check --team=CG --fix
```

#### Scheduled Data Integrity Check
```bash
# Run scheduled check (can be added to cron)
php artisan data:integrity-scheduled
```

### 5. Database Constraints

#### Unique Constraints
- `match_player_assignments`: `['match_id', 'role', 'player_id']`
- `hero_success_rate`: Implicit uniqueness through validation
- `h2h_statistics`: Implicit uniqueness through validation

#### Foreign Key Constraints
- All tables have proper foreign key relationships
- Cascade deletes prevent orphaned records

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logging
- All security violations are logged with ERROR level
- Duplicate attempts are logged with WARNING level
- Cleanup actions are logged with INFO level

### Regular Maintenance
- Run `php artisan data:integrity-check` weekly
- Monitor logs for security violations
- Set up scheduled task for automatic cleanup

### Manual Cleanup
If issues are found, use the cleanup command:
```bash
php artisan data:integrity-check --team=TEAM_NAME --fix
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Input Validation
- All player assignments validated before processing
- Team membership verified at multiple points
- Match data validated before statistics sync

### 2. Process Isolation
- Each team's data processed independently
- No cross-team data mixing in sync process
- Separate validation for each team

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of validation failures
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Automatic cleanup of detected issues

### 4. Data Consistency
- Regular integrity checks
- Automatic duplicate removal
- Cross-reference validation

## Testing the Safeguards

### Test Cross-team Contamination
1. Try to assign player from Team A to Team B match
2. Should be rejected with security violation log

### Test Duplicate Prevention
1. Try to create duplicate hero success rate record
2. Should be skipped with warning log

### Test Data Integrity Check
1. Run `php artisan data:integrity-check --team=CG`
2. Should show clean status or identify issues

## Emergency Procedures

### If Data Corruption is Detected
1. Run integrity check: `php artisan data:integrity-check`
2. Review issues found
3. Run cleanup: `php artisan data:integrity-check --fix`
4. Verify data is clean
5. Check logs for root cause

### If Security Violations are Logged
1. Review violation logs
2. Identify source of cross-team contamination
3. Fix the source code issue
4. Clean up affected data
5. Monitor for recurrence
